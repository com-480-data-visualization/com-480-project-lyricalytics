[Milestone 1](Milestone%201/Lyricalytics.pdf) • [Milestone 2](Milestone%202) • [Milestone 3](#milestone-3)

## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

Please find our Milestone 1 pdf [here](Milestone%201/Lyricalytics.pdf). We have four sections (Dataset, Problematic, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Related work), each with less than 2000 characters, as well as two supplementary appendixes at the end which provide more detail on the dataset feature descriptions and well as related work summaries.


## Milestone 2 (18th April, 5pm)

Please find our [Milestone 2 pdf here](Milestone%202/Lyricalytics%20-%20Milestone%202.pdf), and our [functional project prototype (WIP website) here](Milestone%202/lyricalytics). Due to Github's file size restrictions (and the com-480 organization being over its data quota for Git LFS, rendering it unusable), we had to zip the file `merged_file.csv` into `merged_file.csv.zip`. **YOU MUST UNZIP IT BEFORE TRYING TO RUN THE WEBSITE LOCALLY OR 2 VISUALIZATIONS WILL BE UNABLE TO RENDER!**


## Milestone 3 (30th May, 5pm)
  
Please find our [Milestone 3 Process Book here](Milestone%203/Lyricalytics%20-%Process%20Book.pdf), and our [final website here](Milestone%203/lyricalytics). To run the website, you need only host this folder (e.g., using `python -m http.server` at its root), and then open `index.html` on your browser. Our [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_w0lh865w) is hosted on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ_w0lh865w
